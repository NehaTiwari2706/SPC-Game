Stone Paper and Scissors using Python
“Stone, Paper and Scissors” is a classic game that can be used as an excuse to learn the basics of a programming language. I created this game in python. Each of the two user types in either p(paper), s(Stone), or c(Scissors). The program then announces the winner as well as the basis for determining the winner.
